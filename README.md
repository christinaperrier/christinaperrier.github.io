# Self Introduction
My name is [Christina Perrier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christina-perrier-5373191a7/), I am a junior at Lehigh University majoring in journalism with a minor in psychology. I am the lifestyle editor for [_The Brown and White_](https://thebrownandwhite.com/author/csp223/), an editor for [The Fit Magazine](https://thefitmagazine.com/author/christinaperrier/) and a freelance writer for [Emory Business Magazine](https://www.emorybusiness.com/author/christina-perrier/). 
I am using this page to complete a data project on how safe the Lehigh community feels.

# Powered by Plants: The Rise of Non-Dairy Milk
As someone who has a lactose intolerance and loves the environment, I am passionate about non-dairy milks -- oat is my favorite! I was curious to see what the global market is for these dairy alternatives, as well as the statistics behind their consumption in America, such as the percentage of Americans who have tried non-dairy milks, how many Americans drink non-dairy milk regurlarly, non-dairy milk preferences and reasons why people drink non-dairy milk. I made a poster depicting data I found about plant-based milks, most of which came from [Forbes Business Insights](https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankateman/2019/08/19/non-dairy-milk-alternatives-are-experiencing-a-holy-cow-moment/?sh=111fcb7f4c44). I also included statistics on the detriments cow milk has on the environment to incentivize viewers to go non-dairy if they haven't already!

# The History of Coffee Makers
This is a timeline I made that goes through all the major coffee maker inventions and developments. I love coffee, and I find the origins and long history of coffee very interesting, so I thought displaying it on a timeline would be engaging. I used a Google spreadsheet and TimelineJS to create it.

# Where is most of the world's population located?
This is a chart I made with ChartBuilder that shows three countries with the largest population.

# Blockbusters with the Biggest Budgets
This is a chart I made with ChartBuilder that shows the most expensive movies ever made and their revenues. Disclaimer: some of the movie titles have been abbreviated to make space for the bars.

# Percent of Lehigh Undergraduate Enrollment in the Three Main Colleges
This is a line graph I made with Chartbuilder that shows the percentages of undergraduate Lehigh students in each college for the years 2016-2020.

# The Relationship Between GDP and Life Satisfaction
This is a scatter plot I made with Chartbuilder that shows the relationship between GDP per capita and Life Satisfaction levels of different countries in 2017. The abilities of Chartbuilder are a bit limited, so I was unable to include country labels for each dot. However, there appears to be an overall positive correlation between the two variables -- one may deduce that, generally, countries with higher GDP experience higher levels of life satisfaction, as well.

This is a line graph I made with Chartbuilder that shows the changes in MAU in millions of different social media platoforms (Instagram, Twitter and Facebook). Finding this data was a little difficult for some of the years, as I was only able to turn up estimates for a couple of them. It's interesting to see how much these platforms have grown. I always knew Facebook was the most used platform but it's always surprising to me to see the usage of Facebook because it is the social media I use the least personally -- and I think that goes for a lot of individuals in my generation. It's also interesting to see just how much more usage there is on Facebook compared to the other two.

This is a dashboard I made using Tableau of Lehigh students' party location preferences and how they may differ by gender. I added to the dashboard to include a visualization that looks at preferences based on class year and the gender differences in reasons for party preferences.

# Driving Drunk: Impaired Driving Death Rate, 2012 and 2014
I came upon this dataset while browsing The CDC website. This topic is a relevant and important one, to society as a whole, but also to my age group because of party culture. This is a topic of conversation among my peers because it is likely that we will engage in consuming alcohol and it is essential that we have a plan for how to commute. This is something that many of my peers have strong beliefs about and encourage others to be safe about. I am also at an age where, unfortunately, I know people who have died in car accidents involving a drunk driver. I was curious to see the prevelance of impaired driving fatalities across the nation. This dataset in particular, which was was gathered from [The CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Motor-Vehicle/Impaired-Driving-Death-Rate-All-Ages-2014-US-Map/ctp4-ff5q), looked at impaired driving death rates (per 100,000 population) in 2012 and 2014. A couple of factors the dataset includes are age and gender. First, I was curious to see which states had the highest recorded impaired driving death rates in the respective years. Montant and North Dakota had some of the highest rates during both years. However, what I found particularly interesting about the two maps was that, as a whole, the map for 2014 is slightly darker than 2012, indicating higher rates overall in the latter year. I wonder why this is. Drunk driving campaigns began in the 1980s and seem to have become increasingly widespread, so I would assume impaired driving death rates would lower with time but, then again, two years may not be enough time to show a trend. The next thing I looked at was how these rates differed by gender. I was not surprised to see that there were higher rates for men compared to women for both years. This data could be used to inform how to proceed with drunk driving campaigns, such as increasing the amount of campaigns in states like Montana and the Dakotas and targetting more of a male audience.
