# Self Introduction
My name is [Christina Perrier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christina-perrier-5373191a7/), I am a junior at Lehigh University majoring in journalism with a minor in psychology. I am the lifestyle editor for [_The Brown and White_](https://thebrownandwhite.com/author/csp223/), an editor for [The Fit Magazine](https://thefitmagazine.com/author/christinaperrier/) and a freelance writer for [Emory Business Magazine](https://www.emorybusiness.com/author/christina-perrier/). 
I am using this page to complete a data project on how safe the Lehigh community feels.

Here is a graphic I made to show where [Fall 2019 undergraduate Lehigh students](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf) are from.

As someone who has a lactose intolerance and loves the environment, I am passionate about non-dairy milks -- oat is my favorite! I was curious to see what the global market is for these dairy alternatives, as well as the statistics behind their consumption in America. I made a poster depicting data I found about plant-based milks, accompanied by some statistics on the detriments cow milk has on the environment to incentivize viewers to go non-dairy if they haven't already!

# The History of Coffee Makers
This is a timeline I made that goes through all the major coffee maker inventions and developments. I love coffee, and I find the origins and long history of coffee very interesting, so I thought displaying it on a timeline would be engaging. I used a Google spreadsheet and TimelineJS to create it.

This is a chart I made with ChartBuilder that shows three countries with the largest population.

This is a chart I made using ChartBuilder that shows the percent of undergraduate enrollment in each Lehigh college for the fall 2021.

This is a chart I made with ChartBuilder that shows the most expensive movies ever made and their revenues. Disclaimer: some of the movie titles have been abbreviated to make space for the bars.

This is a line graph I made with Chartbuilder that shows the percentages of undergraduate Lehigh students in each college for the years 2016-2020.

This is a scatter plot I made with Chartbuilder that shows the relationship between GDP per capita and Life Satisfaction levels of different countries in 2017. The abilities of Chartbuilder are a bit limited, so I was unable to include country labels for each dot. However, there appears to be an overall positive correlation between the two variables -- one may deduce that, generally, countries with higher GDP experience higher levels of life satisfaction, as well.

This is a line graph I made with Chartbuilder that shows the changes in MAU in millions of different social media platoforms (Instagram, Twitter and Facebook). Finding this data was a little difficult for some of the years, as I was only able to turn up estimates for a couple of them. It's interesting to see how much these platforms have grown. I always knew Facebook was the most used platform but it's always surprising to me to see the usage of Facebook because it is the social media I use the least personally -- and I think that goes for a lot of individuals in my generation. It's also interesting to see just how much more usage there is on Facebook compared to the other two.
