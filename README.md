# Self Introduction
My name is [Christina Perrier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christina-perrier-5373191a7/), I am a junior at Lehigh University majoring in journalism with a minor in psychology. I am the lifestyle editor for [_The Brown and White_](https://thebrownandwhite.com/author/csp223/), an editor for [The Fit Magazine](https://thefitmagazine.com/author/christinaperrier/) and a freelance writer for [Emory Business Magazine](https://www.emorybusiness.com/author/christina-perrier/). 
I am using this page to complete a data project on how safe the Lehigh community feels.

Here is a graphic I made to show where [Fall 2019 undergraduate Lehigh students](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf) are from.

As someone who has a lactose intolerance and loves the environment, I am passionate about non-dairy milks -- oat is my favorite! I was curious to see what the global market is for these dairy alternatives, as well as the statistics behind their consumption in America. I made a poster depicting data I found about plant-based milks, accompanied by some statistics on the detriments cow milk has on the environment to incentivize viewers to go non-dairy if they haven't already!
